										Coming up with new ideas can be challenging. Shareist helps you capture ideas when you have them and inspiring posts from the web when you see them. The Shareist Content Stream helps you keep your eye on the latest news, videos, tweets on your subject. Work on your posts in private, and when they're ready, publish them on your Notebook or export them to your Wordpress blog.

										You teach History. You have several Shareist Notebooks, one for each of your classes. You include links to information, videos, and images that you trust, your own perspective and insights. You can order and then re-order the information to follow your class curriculum. Your students can access your Notebooks at anytime online.

										You share stuff on Facebook, but sometimes it feels like you're sharing too much. Your Shareist notebook is your personal place to capture everything and anything: Stories, pictures, and videos of your kids to share with your family and friends. Jot down stuff you want to buy, or read later. Keep some stuff private, and other stuff public. Share just the best stuff to Facebook and your blog.

									You're an expert on a topic, a curator. People rely on you for just the important information, and your perspective. When you find anything on your topic, either on the web, or in your Shareist Content Stream capture it into your Shareist notebook. Some stuff can be made public right away, others you may want to keep private to develop later into a bigger piece to publish later on your Notebook and on your blog.

Shareist helps you quickly create great looking pages that automatically link to the stores where people can buy the products through your affiliate link. You save time by being able to focus on finding great stuff and not having to worry about cutting and pasting images, content, and affiliate links.
