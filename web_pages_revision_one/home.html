						The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest cat species, reaching a 
						total body length of up to 3.3 m (11 ft) and weighing up to 306 kg
						(670 lb). Its most recognizable feature is a pattern of dark vertical
						stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside. It has 
						exceptionally stout teeth, and the canines are the longest among living
						felids with a crown height of as much as 74.5 mm (2.93 in) or even 90 mm
						(3.5 in).[4] In zoos, tigers have lived for 20 to 26 years, which also 
						seems to be their longevity in the wild.[5] They are territorial and
						generally solitary but social animals, often requiring large contiguous
						areas of habitat that support their prey requirements.This, coupled with
						the fact that they are indigenous to some of the more densely populated 
						places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans.
						Tigers once ranged widely across Asia, from Turkey in the west to the eastern
						coast of Russia. Over the past 100 years, they have lost 93% of their historic
						range, and have been extirpated from southwest and central Asia, from the islands
						of Java and Bali, and from large areas of Southeast and Eastern Asia. Today, they
						range from the Siberian taiga to open grasslands and tropical mangrove swamps.
						The remaining six tiger subspecies have been classified as endangered by IUCN.
						The global population in the wild is estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948
						individuals, down from around 100,000 at the start of the 20th century,[6] with
						most remaining populations occurring in small pockets isolated from each other.
						Major reasons for population decline include habitat destruction, habitat
						fragmentation and poaching.
